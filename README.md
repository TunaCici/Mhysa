# Mhysa
The name is a High Valerian word for 'mother' and comes from the world of
[ASOIAF](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire) created by [George R. R. Martin](https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/).
Like the name suggests, this repository is the 'mother (helper)' of all my machines and projects.

I'm purposefully leaving the definiton & my goals vague as it might evolve into something else in the future.
For now, this repository includes the following (platform dependency varies):

* **Algorithms:** Fundemental algorithms in C++
* **Data Structures:** Fundemental data structures in C++ (templates)
* **Deprecated:** Old codes, scripts and such
* **Dotfiles:** Configuration files (e.g., `.zshrc`, `.vimrc`)
* **Experimental:** Pieces of codes like solutions to LeetCode problems
* **Scripts:** Shell and Python scripts
* **Tools:** CLI tools (mostly for Linux)
* **READMEs:** Practical notes on various tools & topics
